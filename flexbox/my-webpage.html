                        The Echo caves have been a shelter for humans since the middle stone age.
                        The end of the cave has not yet been found and it is said that the end of the Echo Caves is somewhere close to the Strijdom Tunnel and 
                        The spectacular limestone and dripstone structures inside these natural caverns make for interesting imaginary figures, which can be seen in chambers throughout The Cave as it winds through the mountain.
